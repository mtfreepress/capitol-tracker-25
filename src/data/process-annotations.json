    "howBillsMove": "In order to become law, bills must be passed by their sponsor's chamber, either the Senate or House, and then by the other chamber of the Legislature. Separate bills passed by each chamber must be reconciled if they've passed in different forms, and then transmitted to the governor. The governor can sign a bill, issue a veto, or let a bill become law without his signature. Lawmakers can override a governor’s veto with two-thirds majorities in both chambers.\n\nResolutions are used for legislative actions that don’t create new laws, like adopting procedural rules or requesting studies. House- and Senate-specific resolutions are voted on by one chamber. Joint resolutions must be passed by both. Neither type of resolution requires action by the governor.",
